Dream list

- TOD
- Live there, work there... “ happens all over the world
- What better point than 5 points Station for our transit station
- I don’t know the people that are doing it

Gentrification?
- When we first started working in west side, number one challenge was anti gentrification
- First challenge was to not let this (city of refuge) be taken over by hipsters with a lot of money
- $250M In O4W with institutional investors with high quality assets. “That means a community 
- Edge (in o4w) and The Hill (sandy springs) both have affordable housing. The overlay district for the edge project. In Sandy Springs that required a n affordable housing component. Only way it could work was by the government regulation. That’s the only reason it happened

- Somebody’s gotta have the chutzpah to enforce affordable housing

- What Keith Parker at MARTA calls “knucklehead behavior”
- He asks if any one in the audience has a problem with this

Downtown Atlanta:
- I think the Gulch is gonna be freakin awesome
- I moved my office to the corner...
- There’s an LA group with the ownership of the hawks. 
- Newport at south downtown, that’s gonna be the beginning
- HQ2 has chosen dense urban communities and that says something about the direction of the 
- Re-urbanization of American cities is here to stay, there’s a lot of runway
- 25% or land area in midtown is undeveloped
