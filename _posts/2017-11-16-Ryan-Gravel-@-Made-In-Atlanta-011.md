	- Starts with: who are we?
	- SF,NO have clear civic identities
	- Atlanta’s contribution is the civil rights movement

	- Dr King talked about the aftermath of the civil rights movement as the blessed
	- 5 core values
		- Equity
		- Progress
		- Ambition
		- Access
		- Nature
	- Hundreds of things we need to do
	- Don’t organize them by profession but by values
	- This project is not something most cities do
	- Www.atlcitydesign.com
		- The point of it is to make someone fall in love with Atlanta
		- Flip through
		- The physical copy is coming out in a month, I think the city is going to make it available for purchase

- Generator/Aftercar
	- Generator: Nonprofit
	- Stuart brand, futurist

		- Kinda blade runner, kinda mad max
		- People are gonna spend money
		- Create a platform 
	- Aftercar: bar
	- Generator:

			1. Partner with other researchers. Got a grant from mailchimp, to get a visualization of 50 projects around the world to show you how they’re different, similar. Beta testing now
		2. Activation
			1. They have an econiline van, tricked out
		3. Design
			1. Stone Mountain: what’s the problem with Stone Mountain besides the racism?
			2. “There is a middle ground”
		4. Education

			2. They’re going to hire an executive director for that
- Threefold
	- Least developed of all of these
	- Region is to grow by 2.5M in 20 y
	- Ladders of opportunity
	- Especially around real estate development
	- HQ2: obsession part ii
		- If this were to happen, this desiresbility of in town neighborhoods would be accelerated

Questions and Answers:
- What can Atlantans do to support sustainability of our state rivers?
	- Mostly get people to care
	- Flint river keepers
	- Chattahoochee water keepers
	- Can participate in clean ups
	- Talk to your friends about it
	- Most people didn’t know flint river is there
	- In Hapeville 
	- Chattahoochee now
- When will light rail break ground on beltline?
	- It’s going to happen
	- We did pay for it with our vote last year, maybe the only good news coming out of the election last year
	- Half penny sales tax over next ten years Generates 2.5B we can bond against it now
	- Beltline light rail is like $1b
	- Make sure you’re letting the elected officials know
	- Speak up
- Would you consider running for political office?
	- Nope
	- I don’t care if your trash isn’t getting picked up, call sanitation
- If you were to write
	- Robust strategy for affordability. Look at SF, NYC, they’re 
	- Directly addressing rising taxes and rents for people
	- Rising costs of living (invest in transit)
	- Help people build generational wealth
	- Southside/westside
	- The pressure is coming, but what if it’s your coffee shop, and you can take advantage of that growth
	- Transit:
		- City is doing a good job, but needs to lead the region, including MARTA
		- We should be able to take the train to Savannah or Chattanooga

- How do you think the beltline is affecting gentrification? 
	- Gentr is obviously a problem in Atlanta. I think if we weren’t building the beltline, we’d still be facing this issue
	- I think the beltline organizes this growth, spreads it out (generally a positive thing)
	- Brings a dialogue to the table, which is positive
	- Does it motivate us to action?
	- We need to be having that conversation
- HQ2:
	- I think it’s coming. I think it’s Atlanta’s to lose. I think we have to be actively managing the change that it would bring to Atlanta
	- When you look at what amazon is looking for, and what Atlanta is doing
	- Gwinnett is now taking about transit in a new way
	- They know they have to get on board with that
	- We manage it with:
		- a regional funding stream for affordable housing
		- and a regional transit system
	- That’s my dream, that if amazon comes that it forces the state to
	- MARTA is the 9th largest system in the nation, and receives 0 funding from the state
- Should we ban cars in the central business district?
	- No
	- I don’t know what a car is anymore
	- Excited about what car sharing will mean for the city
	- Will cause as many problems as they solve
	- Prioritize people in this equation
	- Pedestrian used to own the street, Car had to defer to them, we criminalized pedestrianism
	- Think about people first, and worry about cars later
	- We need to stop worrying about traffic and think about other ways to move around
	- Bike lanes, transit, that’s for people
- Favorite ideas for Buford Highway:
	- There is a headline that I’m moving my eyes to Buford Highway, but...
	- Buford Highway is the most dangerous street and highest capacity MARTA 
	- GDOT has agreed to remove a lane of traffic in both directions
- Mayoral runoff?
	- I’m as torn as anybody
	- I would share an answer with you if I had one
	- What I would say is... you know... we’re going to be fine
	- Cathy woolard was the only candidate I knew who could take words like affordable housing or tree canopy, and turn those into actionable policy 
- Biggest untapped potential in Atlanta?
	- People?
	- one of the things I liked about Cathy is she recognized people with an idea and realized people would work for that idea. She removed barriers opened doors and made introductions
	- I’ve seen her do that on other kinds of things
	- You learn about all of the amazing things people are doing around the city and you share those ideas
	- Panel discussion on westside, 12 kids from Washington high school talking about gentrification, moderator said raise your hand if a neighbor has had to move. They said we love the beltline, and they want to go to college and move back into the neighborhood
	- Frame wonky policy into something that makes people care about it. Write a narrative about it
- What could we do in next 5y and come to regret? Kinda like putting a connector through the city
	- If we don’t do anything about affordability, then we’re going to be moving
	- Stunningly beautiful and high quality of life for everybody
	- All we’re talking about is protecting ourselves
	- Problem isn’t we don’t know what to do, it’s that we’re not doing anything about it
	- Lock in a bunch of new greenspace before it gets locked up in development
- What does the additional population look like?
	- Last quarter of City design is about this
	- Density in not just Peachtree but along commercial corridors Hollowell, etc
	- It’s gonna change
	- In downtown, especially around 
	- After Pershing place on Peachtree, the next public place is Atlanta village, 3.5mi away
- Sixpitch
	- I’m terrible at working with people, so I want to keep it small
	- The other ones, there’s a lot of opportunity with that
	- They already have someone lined up for executive director of Generator
	- Opening Aftercar in summer
	- Aftercar 2 May be on the LA river
- History: can you describe early days of beltline?
	- From Chamblee
	- Lived on west campus, GT
	- So I knew these railroads were around
	- Infrastructure isn’t just  about point a and pony b, but it’s about 
	- If we never cross paths, we’re not going to know each other, we’re not going to vote for each other
	- Had 2 thesis proposals:
		- The beltline
		- The gulch property
			- Create regional rail system, like beltline, but connecting suburban towns
			- Atlanta’s a railroad town
			- You used to be able to take the rail to Marietta square
			- Describe it instead as a way of life instead of pitching it as a transportation project
			- If we could do that at a regional level, we wouldn’t be spending hundreds of billions on interchanges 
- I like a capella books
